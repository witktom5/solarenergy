# SolarNature - fictional company landing page

[Live](https://witktom5.github.io/solarnature/)

## Overview

Small HTML, JS, CSS project. No frameworks used. Landing page for a fictional company which sells solar panels. As a challenge I made a custom carousel and for this page. It is fully responsive and I also made my own hamburger menu for it.

No installation needed.
